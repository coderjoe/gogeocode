Dear Coder,

GoGeocode is a simple set of Geocoding tools written in PHP with the express
purpose of taking advantage of the full XML based formats of popular Geocoding
APIs.

It was originally written as part of a geocoding dataset generator and was
released hoping that others might find use for it.

Take, and enjoy,

- Joe Bauser
